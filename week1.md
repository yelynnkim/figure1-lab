# Week 1: Breaking down the KSQ

## KSQ: Using available scRNA-seq data from cancer cell lines, how would you explore the use of the following FDA-approved antibody therapies in additional cancers?
- Trastuzumab: Targets HER2 and is used in the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers.
- Bevacizumab: Targets VEGF and is used for a variety of cancers, including colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, breast, liver, and kidney cancer.

## Defining and understanding constituent components

**1. scRNA-seq data**
scRNA-seq data: single-cell RNA sequencing data
- Single-cell: data is collected from individual cells, rather than from a mixture of many cells. This helps us see the unique features of each cell.
- RNA sequencing (RNA-seq): technology that tells us which genes are being actively used (expressed) in a cell by looking at the RNA, which is the molecule that carries the instructions from DNA to make proteins.

**2. Cancer cell lines**

- Cancer Cells: These are cells that grow uncontrollably and form tumors.
- Cell Lines: When scientists take cancer cells from a tumor and grow them in the lab, they create what’s called a cell line. These cells keep growing and dividing, so scientists can use them for many experiments.

Cancer cell lines are important, as they let scientists study cancer in a controlled environment and test how different treatments, like drugs or antibody therapies, work on these cells before trying them in humans.

**3. Antibody therapies**

Antibody therapies are treatments that use specially designed antibodies to target and destroy cancer cells. These lab-made antibodies are designed to stick to specific proteins on the surface of cancer cells. Once attached, they can help the immune system recognize and kill the cancer cells, or they can deliver toxic substances directly to the cancer cells to destroy them.

**4. Trastuzumab**

Trastuzumab is an FDA-approved antibody therapy that specifically targets a protein called HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2). It is used to treat cancers that have high levels of HER2, specifically HER2-positive breast cancer and gastric (stomach) cancer.

How does Trastuzumab work?
- Trastuzumab binds to the HER2 protein on the surface of cancer cells. By attaching to HER2, it blocks the signals that tell the cancer cells to grow and divide. It also helps the immune system recognize and destroy the cancer cells.

**5. Bevacizumab**

Bevacizumab is another FDA-approved antibody therapy that specifically targets a protein called VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). It is used to treat a variety of cancers, including colorectal, lung, glioblastoma (a type of brain cancer), breast, liver, and kidney cancer.

How does Bevacizumab work?
- Bevacizumab binds to the VEGF protein and thus prevents VEGF from signaling the formation of new blood vessels. Tumors need new blood vessels to grow and get nutrients. Without new blood vessels, the tumor's growth is slowed or stopped because it can't get enough nutrients.

## Drawing connections between components

By integrating scRNA-seq data with the study of cancer cell lines, researchers can uncover new applications for existing FDA-approved antibody therapies. This approach helps identify additional cancers that may respond to treatments like Trastuzumab and Bevacizumab, potentially broadening the scope of effective cancer therapies and improving patient outcomes.
